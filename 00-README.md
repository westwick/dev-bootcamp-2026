## How to Use AI as Your Tutor

Use AI like a tutor, not a code generator. The goal is understanding, not just working code.

### ✅ DO Ask AI:
- "Explain [concept] like I'm completely new to programming"
- "Why does [tool/technology] exist? What problem does it solve?"
- "What did developers do before [modern tool]? What was painful?"
- "Walk me through what happens step-by-step when [action occurs]"
- "I got this error: [error]. Explain what it means and why it happened"
- "Here's my code: [code]. What's wrong and why doesn't it work?"
- "What's the difference between [thing A] and [thing B]?"

### ❌ DON'T Ask AI:
- "Build this whole app for me"
- "Write all the code I need"
- "Just give me the solution"

### 💡 When You're Stuck:
Paste your code and ask: "What is wrong and why?" or "What am I misunderstanding here?"

## After This Bootcamp

You will be able to confidently say:

> "I have built and deployed a full-stack application from scratch. I understand how the web works from HTTP to database to frontend frameworks. I know version control, branching strategies, and professional workflows. I can work with APIs, databases, and modern JavaScript. This is not tutorial knowledge—this is real developer knowledge."

Good luck! 🚀
